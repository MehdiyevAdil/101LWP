                <p>
                    Mr. Bean attends a mathematics exam, where he tries to copy from a student (Paul Bown) under the
                    nose of the invigilator (Rudolph Walker). Afterwards, he surreptitiously changes into his swimming
                    trunks so as not to be noticed by someone sitting nearby at a beach (Roger Sloman) and later
                    struggles to stay awake during a church service, much to the annoyance of the man sitting next to
                    him, Mr. Sprout (Richard Briers).</p>

                <p>Bean tries out his new credit card at a department store, visits a fancy restaurant for his birthday
                    and is served an unwanted dish, leading him to try a variety of strategies to avoid eating it, and
                    then has an unfortunate altercation with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</p>

                <p>Bean visits the local swimming pool where he realises that he is scared of diving, tries to find a
                    way to leave the car park without paying, makes a sandwich in the park sitting next to a man (Angus
                    Deayton), jumps a traffic light in his car by getting out and pushing it, and then joins his
                    girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler) to watch a scary movie at the cinema.</p>

                    his camera stolen and later finds a unique way of identifying the culprit (Nick Hancock). After
                    leaving his shoe on top of a car, Bean hops around town to retrieve it and later takes his
                    girlfriend to see a magic show and have a dance at the disco for a night.</p>

                <p>Bean wakes up late for his dental appointment, forcing him to drive to the clinic while dressing and
                    brushing his teeth. At the clinic, his appointment progresses badly after he accidentally
                    anesthetizes the dentist (Richard Wilson), forcing him to finish the dental procedure himself. He
                    then heads to the park to have a peaceful picnic by himself, but is then pestered by wasps.</p>

                    accident, he has a nightmare about them and his neighbour. With his stomach turning, he goes outside
                    of his room naked to complain to his other neighbour who is playing very loud music, but
                    accidentally gets himself locked out, prompting him to try sneaking back into his room without being
                    seen.Guest star: Danny La Rue</p>

                    a large recliner at the January sales of a department store and has a unique way of driving then
                    home, then tries painting his flat himself and starts off the new year with a bang.</p>

                    and not with his hands, Bean's poor aim leads him on an elaborate tour around town before ultimately

            <h3>Rowan Atkinson</h3>
            <img src="img/Rowan_Atkinson.jpg" alt="Atkinson">
            <p>Rowan Sebastian Atkinson CBE (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor, comedian and writer. He played
                the title roles on the sitcoms Blackadder (1983–1989) and Mr. Bean (1990–1995), and the film series
                Johnny English (2003–2018). Atkinson first came to prominence in the BBC sketch comedy show Not the Nine
                O'Clock News (1979–1982), receiving the 1981 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment
                Performance, and The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) where he performed a skit. Subsequent skits on stage
                have featured solo performances as well as collaborations.

                His other film work includes the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983), playing a bumbling vicar
                in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), voicing the red-billed hornbill Zazu in The Lion King (1994), and
                playing jewellery salesman Rufus in Love Actually (2003). He portrayed Mr. Bean in the film adaptations
                Bean (1997) and Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). Atkinson also featured in the BBC sitcom The Thin Blue Line
                (1995–1996), and he played the titular character in ITV's Maigret (2016–2017). His work in theatre
                includes the role of Fagin in the 2009 West End revival of the musical Oliver!.

                Atkinson was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British comedy in 2003,[3] and
                among the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of fellow comedians.[4] Throughout his career, he has
                collaborated with screenwriter Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, both of whom he met at the
                Oxford University Dramatic Society during the 1970s. In addition to his 1981 BAFTA, Atkinson received an
                Olivier Award for his 1981 West End theatre performance in Rowan Atkinson in Revue. Atkinson was
                appointed a CBE in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.</p>
            <h3>Matilda Ziegler</h3>

                opera EastEnders, playing Donna Ludlow, the illegitimate daughter of series regular Kathy Beale. Donna
                contended with prostitution, an attempted gang rape, heroin addiction and finally suicide (dying of a
                heroin overdose). The final death scenes of Ziegler's character, who had choked to death on her own
                vomit, have been hailed as one of the most powerful anti-drug images ever screened on the programme.[2]

                In the early 1990s, Ziegler starred in the ITV comedy, Mr. Bean, where she played multiple characters,

                the revived series from 2015 to 2019.

                Other television credits include: Lark Rise to Candleford (2008–2010) in which she played the part of
                Pearl Pratt, in the BBC adaptation of Flora Thompson's novel; Harbour Lights (1999); Where the Heart Is
                (2000); Holby City (2003); An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1998); The Bill (2003), and Home, alongside
                Anthony Sher in an adaptation of J.G. Ballard's novel.

                Ziegler played Ruth, wife of car salesman Toni, in the BBC sitcom Swiss Toni (2003–04). She also
                appeared in the BAFTA Television Award winning drama, Sex Traffic (2004). In 2005, she played Christine
                Miller in the fourth series of The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, and in 2007, she guest starred in the BBC
                One daytime medical drama Doctors. She also appeared in Outnumbered, Lewis (in the episode 'The Soul of
                Genius', 2012), Death in Paradise (2013), and Vera (in the episode "Young Gods", 2013).

                In 2015, she appeared in an episode of Foyle's War, and in series 4 episode of Call the Midwife. In 2020
                she appeared in a second season episode of The Alienist, and appeared in two episodes of The Girlfriend
                Experience in 2021.

                Ziegler's film roles include Decadence (1994), Jilting Joe (1998), City Slacker (2012), and The Rhythm
                Section (2019) where she played Blake Lively's mother.</p>

            <p>Mr. Bean features a choral theme tune in the key of C major written by Howard Goodall (adapted from a
                passage of "Locus iste" by Anton Bruckner) and performed by the Choir of Southwark Cathedral (episodes
                2–11 and 14; opening of episode 15) and Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford (episodes 12 and 13; closing of
                episode 15). The words sung during the title sequences are in Latin:
            <h3>1.Vale homo qui est faba – "Farewell":</h3>

            </audio>
            The theme was later released on Goodall's album Choral Works. Goodall also wrote an accompanying music
            track for many episodes. The first episode of Mr. Bean did not feature the choral theme tune, but
            instead an up-beat instrumental piece also composed by Goodall, which was more an incidental tune than a
            theme. It was used while Bean drove between locations intimidating the blue Reliant, and as such, was
            sometimes heard in later episodes whenever Bean's nemesis is seen. The instrumental of the theme tune
            was used in the original series finale of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series titled "Double Trouble".

            In the episode "Tee Off, Mr. Bean", Goodall's choral theme tune for another Richard Curtis comedy, The
            Vicar of Dibley, is heard playing on a car stereo. In "Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean", while playing with
            Queen's Royal Guards figurines and the nativity set, he hums "The British Grenadiers", which was quoted
            in the theme to Blackadder Goes Forth.[34]

            Mr. Bean appeared in the music video of a 1991 fundraising single for Comic Relief, fronted by Hale and
            Pace, entitled "The Stonk".[35] Mr. Bean also appeared in the music video for the Boyzone single
            "Picture of You",[36] which was the main theme song for the first film adaptation.

            Mr. Bean also made a Comic Relief record in 1992, entitled "(I Want To Be) Elected" and which was
            credited to 'Mr. Bean and Smear Campaign featuring Bruce Dickinson'. It was a cover of the Alice Cooper
            song of the same name, and reached number 9 in the UK singles chart.[37]

                In 2012, Atkinson reprised his character for a live performance as part of the London 2012 Summer
                Olympics opening ceremony. In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the London Symphony Orchestra in its
                performance of "Chariots of Fire", conducted by Simon Rattle. For this scene, Bean does not wear his
                usual brown tweed sports jacket but the traditional clothing of the musician – white tie and tails. As
                they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the synthesiser
                and gets jealous of the more interesting part being played on the grand piano. Still bored, he takes out
                his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and
                tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the
                synthesizer until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with
                his serviette, he throws it into the grand piano.

                He then falls asleep continuing to play the note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film
                Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with
                them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front,
                Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him,
                whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding that the rest of the orchestra
                have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle,
                plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound then stops.[51]

                Director Danny Boyle later explained: "It wasn't actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his
                character was Derek"[52] In 2021's "Happy Birthday Mr Bean" documentary, Atkinson and Curtis also stated
                that the performance wasn't actually intended to be the character Mr. Bean.[53] Although the official
                Olympic YouTube channel and the live commentary promoted it as Mr. Bean</p>
